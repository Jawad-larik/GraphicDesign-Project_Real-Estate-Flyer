# GraphicDesign-Project_Real-Estate-Flyer
Elegant Home for Sale – Real Estate Flyer Design

This flyer was created as a final project for my Graphic Design course, where the objective was to recreate and elevate a professional real estate promotional poster. I focused on delivering a clean, modern layout that blends luxury appeal with usability.

Using Adobe Illustrator, I incorporated:

A high-quality twilight image of a modern estate to convey elegance.

A dynamic diagonal layout to break visual monotony and lead the viewer’s eye.

Bold serif and sans-serif typography for strong hierarchy and brand emphasis.

Custom color accents (deep navy, gold, and green) to add uniqueness while maintaining professionalism.

Interactive elements like call-to-action buttons and icon-driven contact info to enhance user experience.

This project reflects my ability to translate client objectives into visually compelling, on-brand marketing collateral using industry-standard tools and techniques.
